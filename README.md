It is the project of Machine learning.
The system is designed for classifying Parkinson's Disease.


Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disease. Damage or death of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain can lead to severe motor and cognitive impairment. In order to achieve the prediction, diagnosis and monitoring of this disease, we use a variety of machine learning methods to analyze the voice recording data sets of Parkinson's disease patients and control group, so as to make a reasonable prediction of Parkinson's disease. Our focus is on assessing the most efficient feature groups and prediction classifiers. Thus, patients and healthy people can be distinguished. We used ensemble models, feeding all the feature subsets and the parameters are optimized. The results show that the best accuracy can reach 0.75, best f1 score can be 0.72 and best recall score can be 0.72.
